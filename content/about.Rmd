# Education

I have a B.A. in Biological Sciences from the University of Oxford and an M.Sc. in Behavioural Economics from the University of Essex. 

The majority of the coding skills I've picked up are self taught. In particular, I'm a big fan of DataCamp and you can find a list of the courses I've completed [here](https://www.datacamp.com/profile/mitchelfruin).

# Employment

I currently work as a Junior Data Scientist in the Intelligence Team at a marketing agency called [SHARE](https://sharecreative.com/intelligence-suite).

# The Site

I built the site using the excellent [`blogdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) R package for a few reasons:

* To learn the (very) basics of web development.
* To encourage myself to read (and actually think about what I've learned). 
* To use R for something that didn't feel like work.
