# The Site

I built the site using the R package [`blogdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) for a few reasons:

* To learn the (very) basics of web development.
* To encourage myself to read (and actually think about what I've learned). 
* To use R for something that didn't feel like work. 

The site is still very much a work-in-progress but is split into two sections based loosely on whether I've had an idea or I'm just recapping someone else's:

* Posts.
    + Traditional blog posts at the intersection of topics that I'm interested in and trying to learn more about, including:
        - Programming. 
        - Data Science (analytics, statistics, and machine learning).
        - Alternative approaches to economics (behavioural, complexity).
        - Evolutionary biology.
* Summaries.
    + Short notes on non-fiction books, academic papers, and textbooks. 
        - Focused on illustrating concepts using R.
        - Won't be exhaustive.
