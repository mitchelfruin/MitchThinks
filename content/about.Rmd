# Education

I have a B.A. in Biological Sciences from the University of Oxford and an M.Sc. in Behavioural Economics from the University of Essex. 

# Employment

I currently work as a Junior Data Scientist in the Intelligence Team at a marketing agency called [SHARE](https://sharecreative.com/).  

# The Site

I built the site using the R package [`blogdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) for a few reasons:

* I wanted to learn the (very) basics of web development.
* I wanted to post book summaries to encourage myself to read (and actually think about what I've read). 
* I wanted to use R for something that didn't feel like work. 

The site is still very much a work-in-progress but is broadly split into two sections:

* Book summaries.
    + Selective summaries of interesting non-fiction books.
    + Focused on trying to illustrate concepts using R, with a few of my thoughts thrown in, rather than providing an exhaustive summary or review. 
* Interests.
    + Random articles on various topics that I'm interested in and trying to learn more about, including:
        - Programming. 
        - Data Science (analytics, statistics, and machine learning).
        - Alternative approaches to economics (e.g. behavioural, complexity).
        - Evolutionary biology.
