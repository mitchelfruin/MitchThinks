# Education

I have a B.A. in Biological Sciences from the University of Oxford and an M.Sc. in Behavioural Economics from the University of Essex. 

# Employment

I currently work as a Junior Data Scientist in the Intelligence Team at a marketing agency called [SHARE](https://sharecreative.com/).  

# The site

I built the site using the R package `blogdown` for a few reasons:

* I wanted to learn the (very) basics of web development.
* I wanted to post book summaries to encourage myself to read (and actually think about what I've read). 
* I wanted to post R code somewhere publicly so that people could criticise it. 

The site is split into two sections:

* Book Summaries
    + Self-contained summaries of interesting non-fiction books, illustrated with R code, with a few of my thoughts thrown in. 
* Interests
    + Compilations of notes on various topics that I'm trying to learn about, including:
        - Programming 
        - Data Science (analytics, statistics, and machine learning)
        - Alternative approaches to economics (e.g. behavioural, complexity)
        - Evolutionary biology
    + Once complete, each page would hopefully serve as an *Intro to X*.
