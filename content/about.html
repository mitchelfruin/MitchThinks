<h1>Education</h1>
<p>I have a B.A. in Biological Sciences from the University of Oxford and an M.Sc. in Behavioural Economics from the University of Essex.</p>
<p>The majority of the coding skills I’ve picked up are self taught. In particular, I’m a big fan of DataCamp and you can find a list of the courses I’ve completed <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/profile/mitchelfruin">here</a>.</p>

<div id="the-site" class="section level1">
<h1>The Site</h1>
<p>I built the site using the excellent <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/"><code>blogdown</code></a> R package for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>To learn the (very) basics of web development.</li>
<li>To encourage myself to read (and actually think about what I’ve learned).</li>
<li>To use R for something that didn’t feel like work.</li>
</ul>

<div id="contact" class="section level1">
