<div id="the-site" class="section level1">
<h1>The Site</h1>
<p>I built the site using the R package <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/"><code>blogdown</code></a> for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>To learn the (very) basics of web development.</li>
<li>To post book summaries to encourage myself to read (and actually think about what I’ve read).</li>
<li>To use R for something that didn’t feel like work.</li>
</ul>
<p>The site is still very much a work-in-progress (unfinished articles are marked with a *) but is broadly split into two sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Book summaries.
<ul>
<li>Selective summaries of non-fiction books.</li>
<li>Focused on trying to illustrate concepts using R, with a few of my thoughts thrown in, rather than providing an exhaustive summary or review.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Interests.
<ul>
<li>Random articles at the intersection of topics that I’m interested in and trying to learn more about, including:
<ul>
<li>Programming.</li>
<li>Data Science (analytics, statistics, and machine learning).</li>
<li>Alternative approaches to economics (e.g. behavioural, complexity).</li>
<li>Evolutionary biology.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
