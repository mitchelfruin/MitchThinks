<div id="education" class="section level1">
<h1>Education</h1>
<p>I have a B.A. in Biological Sciences from the University of Oxford and an M.Sc. in Behavioural Economics from the University of Essex.</p>
</div>
<div id="employment" class="section level1">
<h1>Employment</h1>
<p>I currently work as a Junior Data Scientist in the Intelligence Team at a marketing agency called <a href="https://sharecreative.com/">SHARE</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-site" class="section level1">
<h1>The site</h1>
<p>I built the site using the R package <code>blogdown</code> for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>I wanted to learn the (very) basics of web development.</li>
<li>I wanted to post book summaries to encourage myself to read (and actually think about what I’ve read).</li>
<li>I wanted to post R code somewhere publicly so that people could criticise it.</li>
</ul>
<p>The site is split into two sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Book Summaries
<ul>
<li>Self-contained summaries of interesting non-fiction books, illustrated with R code, with a few of my thoughts thrown in.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Interests
<ul>
<li>Compilations of notes on various topics that I’m trying to learn about, including:
<ul>
<li>Programming</li>
<li>Data Science (analytics, statistics, and machine learning)</li>
<li>Alternative approaches to economics (e.g. behavioural, complexity)</li>
<li>Evolutionary biology</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Once complete, each page would hopefully serve as an <em>Intro to X</em>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
