<div id="the-site" class="section level1">
<h1>The Site</h1>
<p>I built the site using the R package <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/"><code>blogdown</code></a> for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>To learn the (very) basics of web development.</li>
<li>To encourage myself to read (and actually think about what I’ve learned).</li>
<li>To use R for something that didn’t feel like work.</li>
</ul>
<p>The site is still very much a work-in-progress but is split into two sections based loosely on whether I’ve had an idea or I’m just recapping someone else’s:</p>
<ul>
<li>Posts.
<ul>
<li>Traditional blog posts at the intersection of topics that I’m interested in and trying to learn more about, including:
<ul>
<li>Programming.</li>
<li>Data Science (analytics, statistics, and machine learning).</li>
<li>Alternative approaches to economics (behavioural, complexity).</li>
<li>Evolutionary biology.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Summaries.
<ul>
<li>Short notes on non-fiction books, academic papers, and textbooks.
<ul>
<li>Focused on illustrating concepts using R.</li>
<li>Won’t be exhaustive.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>

<p>Contact me via any of the interactive icons on the homepage.</p>
