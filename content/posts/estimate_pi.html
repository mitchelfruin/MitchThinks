<p>I was given <em>Infinite Powers</em> by Steven Strogatz as a Christmas present (thanks Grandma). It’s a good book and I’d recommend it to anyone who ever sat in a maths class and genuinely asked the teacher, “err, but, like, why?” Most of the time, in my experience anyway, questions like that one didn’t get a good answer. The response tended to be either a ‘why must you always interrupt me’ look or an exasperated “because it’s on the mark scheme and you need to know this for the exam”.</p>
<p>One of my favourite sections of the book involved Strogatz recounting how Archimedes estimated the value of <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>. The reason being that there’s a popular data science interview question which also requires the applicant to estimate <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>. So, I thought it would be fun to compare Archimedes’ estimate to what I’ll be (shamelessly and repeatedly) calling <strong>R</strong>chimedes’ estimate.</p>
<div id="archimedes-estimate" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Archimedes’ estimate</h1>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> is defined as the ratio between the circumference and diameter of a circle</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\pi = \frac{C}{d}\]</span></p>
<p>We know that the diameter is twice the radius:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[d = 2r\]</span></p>
<p>Which means we can write:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\pi = \frac{C}{2r}\]</span></p>
<p>If we approximate the circumference of a circle using a hexagon inside it (as shown in the image below), then we know that (because a hexagon is 6 equilateral triangles) the distance around the edge of the hexagon (in bold) is <span class="math inline">\(6r\)</span>.</p>
<center>
<img src="/images/pi_hexagon_in.png" alt="Internal hexagon for lower bound." />
</center>
<p>Since the hexagon is inside the circle, we know that the distance around its edges must be an underestimate of the circumference. So, we can write:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[C &gt; 6r\]</span></p>
<p>If we substitute this into our previous formula for <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> we get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\pi = \frac{C}{2r} &gt; \frac{6r}{2r} = 3\]</span></p>
<p>In other words, we get a lower bound for the true value of <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>. We know it must be larger than 3.</p>
<p>Now we can carry out the same process with a hexagon that is just outside the circle to get an upper bound for <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>.</p>
<center>
<img src="/images/pi_hexagon_out.png" alt="External hexagon for upper bound" />
</center>
<p>Whereas before each edge in the hexagon was length <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, now each edge has length <span class="math inline">\(\frac{2}{3}\sqrt{3}\times r\)</span> (you can figure this out from the fact that the height of each of the equilateral triangles comprising the hexagon is <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>). So, we can multiply this by 6 to find the distance around the edge of the external hexagon:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[6 \times \frac{2}{3}\sqrt{3}\times r = 4r\sqrt{3}\]</span></p>
<p>This time we know that our hexagon is an overestimate for the circumference:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[C &lt; 4r\sqrt{3}\]</span></p>
<p>If we again substitute this into our formula for <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> we get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\pi = \frac{C}{2r} &lt; \frac{4r\sqrt{3}}{2r} = 2\sqrt{3}\]</span></p>
<p>Now we have a corresponding upper bound for the true value of <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>. We know it must be less than <span class="math inline">\(2\sqrt{3}\)</span>, which rounded to 2 decimal places is <span class="math inline">\(3.46\)</span>.</p>
<p>So, using our two hexagons we have found an interval for <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[3 &lt; \pi &lt; 3.46\]</span></p>
<p>Staggeringly, Archimedes carried out a process equivalent to the one we just played through with a 96-sided shape and found the following interval:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[3\frac{10}{70} &lt; \pi &lt; 3\frac{10}{71}\]</span>
Which rounded to 3 decimal places is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[3.141 &lt; \pi &lt; 3.143\]</span></p>
<p>This means he found <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> correct to 2 decimal places, <span class="math inline">\(3.14\)</span>, which is as much precision as most people know <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> to nowadays.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> <strong>R</strong>chimedes’ estimate</h1>
<p>OK, you’re dressed to impress, you’ve politely said yes to a tea because you read a social psychology paper once that said interviewers preferred candidates that did, and you can feel a few beads of nervous sweat on the small of your back. You sit down at the interview table and the interviewer hands you a laptop with a set of instructions already open:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have a function which takes the input <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and outputs <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> random numbers between 0 and 1. Estimate the value of <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the customary moment of panic, you decide to actually think it through.</p>
<p>Well, the easiest way you can think of to estimate <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> is to find the area of a circle with a radius of <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.</p>
<p>After all,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\text{Area of a circle} &amp;= \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \\
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>So if <span class="math inline">\(\text{radius} = 1\)</span>, then</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\text{Area of a circle} &amp;= \pi \times 1^2 \\
&amp;= \pi
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Alright, so what would a circle with radius of 1 look like?</p>
<p><img src="/posts/estimate_pi_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="480" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>How does this help us? Well, if we use the random number function twice we can generate pairs of random coordinates. Let’s plot 100 such coordinates:</p>
<p><img src="/posts/estimate_pi_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="480" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Now, if we superimpose our random pairs of coordinates onto our circle with radius 1:</p>
<p><img src="/posts/estimate_pi_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="480" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Hopefully the plan is starting to become clear.</p>
<p>We need to calculate the proportion of random points that are inside the circle.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/estimate_pi_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="480" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>In this instance, the proportion of our random points that fall inside the circle is 0.82. This is an estimate for the area of one quarter of the circle.</p>
<p>So, to find an estimate for the area of the whole circle (which we know to be <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>) all we have to do is multiply that proportion by 4. In this case, our estimate for <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> turns out to be 3.28.</p>
<p>That’s an OK estimate but, what if we want a greater degree of accuracy? All we need to do is use more random points.</p>
<p>Say we ran through the whole process again but this time with 1000 points:</p>
<p><img src="/posts/estimate_pi_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="480" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Now, the proportion of points inside the circle is 0.787 giving us an estimate for <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> of 3.148. <code>R</code> provides the value of <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> to 6 decimal places as 3.141593. We’re getting closer.</p>
</div>
<div id="can-we-beat-a-guy-whos-been-dead-for-over-2000-years" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Can we beat a guy who’s been dead for over 2000 years?</h1>
<p>So we’ve got a process that can help us estimate <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>. We overlay random points on one quarter of a circle, find out the proportion that fall inside the circle, and then multiply by 4.</p>
<p>Here’s an R function that plays through this process for us:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>R_chimedes &lt;- function(n_points) {
  # Generate random pair of coordinates between 0 and 1
  x &lt;- runif(n_points)
  y &lt;- runif(n_points)
  # For each pair find distance from the origin
  o_dist &lt;- sqrt(x^2 + y^2)
  # If o_dist &lt;= 1, then inside or on the circle
  in_or_out &lt;- o_dist &lt;= 1
  # Estimate pi
  4 * mean(in_or_out == TRUE)
}</code></pre>
<p>All we need to do is choose how many random points to use, <code>n_points</code>.</p>
<p>So, how many random points do we need before we are more accurate than Archimedes was?</p>
<p>Let’s try a few different powers of 10. For each different value of <code>n_points</code>, we’ll calculate 3 estimates of <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/estimate_pi_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png" width="776.64" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>We can see that once we use <span class="math inline">\(1,000,000\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(10^6\)</span>) random points, our estimate is getting pretty close consistently. The graph gets too small to read so let’s zoom in on the right hand end of the x-axis:</p>
<p><img src="/posts/estimate_pi_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="776.64" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Now we can see that (in this instance) when we use <span class="math inline">\(100,000,000\)</span> random points all 3 of our estimates for <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> are more accurate than the range Archimedes specified. This blew me away and I think it compounds just how impressive his calculation was.</p>

<div id="knowing-vs.understanding" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Knowing vs. Understanding</h1>
<p>The thought that I kept returning to whilst reading <em>Infinite Powers</em> was that there is a much bigger difference than I had realised between <em>knowing</em> something and <em>understanding</em> it. For example, I have known for a long time that the formula for the area of a circle was <span class="math inline">\(\pi r^2\)</span> but until reading this book I didn’t have any sense of understanding about why that was true.</p>
<p>Throughout all of school and most of uni all I really did was know stuff. Now I want to understand stuff. And, if that means that there’s necessarily less stuff involved, then I’m fine with that.</p>
