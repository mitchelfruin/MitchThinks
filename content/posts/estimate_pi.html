<p>A couple of month’s ago I read Steven Strogatz’s Inifinite Powers.</p>
<p>It’s a good book overall but the first half is great. I’d recommend it to anyone who ever asked, “but, like, why?” in a maths class in secondary school and didn’t get a good answer (typically either a ‘don’t interrupt me’ look or worse, “because it is”).</p>
<p>My two favourite sections invovled Storgatz recounting how Archimedes discovered the formula for the area of a circle and how he estimated <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>. This post will only cover the latter. The reason being that there’s a popular data science interview question which requires the applicant to estimate <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>. So, I thought it would be fun to compare Archimedes’ estimate to what I’ll be (shamelessly and repeatedly) calling <strong>R</strong>chimedes’ estimate.</p>
<div id="archimedes-estimate" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Archimedes’ estimate</h1>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> is defined as the ratio between the circumference and diameter of a circle</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\pi = \frac{C}{d}\]</span></p>
<p>We know that the diameter is twice the radius:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[d = 2r\]</span></p>
<p>So, we know that we can write:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\pi = \frac{C}{2r}\]</span></p>
<p>What we need is an estimate for C.</p>
<p>If we approximate the circumference of a circle using a hexagon inside it (as shown in the image below), then we know that (because a hexagon is 6 equilateral triangles) the distance around the edge of the hexagon (in bold) is <span class="math inline">\(6r\)</span>.</p>
<center>
<img src="/images/pi_hexagon_in.png" alt="Internal hexagon for lower bound." />
</center>
<p>So, if we know that 6 times the radius is an underestimate of the circumference of the circle, then we can write:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[C &gt; 6r\]</span></p>
<p>If we substitue this into our previous formula for <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> we get:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\pi = \frac{C}{2r} &gt; \frac{6r}{2r} = 3\]</span></p>
<p>In other words, we get a lower bound for the true value of <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>. We know it must be larger than 3.</p>
<p>If you carry out the same process with a hexagon that is outside the circle, then we can get an upper bound for <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>.</p>
<center>

</center>
<p>Staggeringly, Archimedes carried out a process equivalent to the one we just played through with a hexagon on a 96-sided shape and found the following interval:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[3\frac{10}{70} &lt; \pi &lt; 3\frac{10}{71}\]</span></p>
<p>This means he found <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> correct to 2 decimal places, <span class="math inline">\(3.14\)</span>, which is as much precision as most people know <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> to nowadays.</p>

<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> <strong>R</strong>chimedes’ estimate</h1>
<p>Ok, you’re dressed to impress, you’ve politely said yes to a tea because you read a social psychology paper once that said interviewers preferred candidates that did, and you can feel a few beads of nervous sweat on the small of your back. You sit down at the interview table and the interviewer hands you a laptop with a set of instructions already open:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have a function which takes the input <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and outputs <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> random numbers between 0 and 1. Estimate the value of <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the customary moment of panic, you decide actually think it through.</p>
<p>Well, the easiest way you can think of to estimate <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> is to find the area of a circle with a radius of <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.</p>
<p>After all,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\text{Area of a circle} &amp;= \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \\
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>So if <span class="math inline">\(\text{radius} = 1\)</span>, then</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\text{Area of a circle} &amp;= \pi \times 1^2 \\
&amp;= \pi
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Alright, so what would a circle with radius of 1 look like?</p>
<p><img src="/posts/estimate_pi_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="480" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>How does this help us? Well, if we use the random number function twice we can generate pairs of random coordinates. Let’s plot 100 such coordinates:</p>
<p><img src="/posts/estimate_pi_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="480" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Now, if we superimpose our random pairs of coordinates onto our circle with radius 1:</p>
<p><img src="/posts/estimate_pi_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="480" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Hopefully the plan is starting to become clear.</p>
<p>We need to calculate the proportion of random points that are inside the circle.</p>
<p><img src="/posts/estimate_pi_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="480" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>In this instance, the proportion of our random points that fall inside the circle is 0.82.</p>
<p>So, to find an estimate for the area of the circle (which we know to be <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>) all we have to do is multiply that proportion by 4. In this case, our estimate for <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> turns out to be 3.28.</p>
<p>That’s an ok estimate but, what if we want a greater degree of accuracy? All we need to do is use more random points.</p>
<p>Say we ran through the whole process again but this time with 1000 points:</p>
<p><img src="/posts/estimate_pi_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png" width="480" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Now, the proportion of points inside the circle is 0.787 giving us an estimate for <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> of 3.148. <code>R</code> provides the value of <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> to 6 decimal places as 3.1415927. We’re getting closer.</p>

<p>How many random points do we need before we are more accurate than Archimedes?</p>
<p>Lets try a few different powers of 10.</p>

<p>About undersatdning vs. knowing.</p>
<p>For a long time, definitely throughout all of school, all I really did was <em>know</em> stuff. Now, I want to <em>understand</em> stuff. And even if that means there’s less stuff involved, I’m fine with that. Value of understanding is that you begin to see connections between seemingly disparate points of <em>knowledge</em>.</p>
