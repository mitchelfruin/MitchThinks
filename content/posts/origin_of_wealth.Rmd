# Summary

In the first section of *The Origin of Wealth* Beinhocker outlines 5 key differences between traditional (neoclassical) economics and complexity economics:

1. Dynamics
2. Agents
3. Networks
4. Emergence
5. Evolution

I'll try to illustrate each in turn (the emphasised summaries heading each section are taken from Beinhocker without adaptation). 

# 1st difference: Dynamics

> Traditional: 
> 
> * Closed, static, linear systems in equilibrium
>
> Complexity:
> 
> * Open, dynamic, non-linear systems far from equilibrium

# 2nd difference: Agents

> Traditional: 
>
>* Modeled collectively (homogenous)
>* Use complex deductive calculations to make decisions
>* Have complete information
>* Random errors (no biases)
>* No learning or adaptation (already optimal)
>
> Complexity:
>
>* Modeled individually (heterogenous)
>* Use inductive heuristics to make decisions
>* Have incomplete information
>* Some biases
>* Learn and adapt over time

# 3rd difference: Networks

> Traditional:
>
>* Agents only interact indirectly through market mechanisms
>
> Complexity:
>
>* Explicitly model interactions between individual agents
>* Networks of relationships change over time 

# 4th difference: Emergence

> Traditional:
>
>* Separate disciplines for micro- and macroeconomics
>
> Complexity:
>
>* No hard distinction between micro- and macro-
>* Macro patterns are emergent result of mirco-level behaviours and interactions 

# 5th difference: Evolution 

> Traditional:
>
>* No mechanism for endogenously creating novelty, or growth in order/complexity
>
> Complexity:
>
>* Process of differentiation, selection, and amplification generates novelty and is responsible for economy's growth in order and complexity
