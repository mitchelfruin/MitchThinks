Most non-fiction books teach you **what** to think. They give you a new set of facts to trot out when someone brings up pop psychology at the pub or let you feel smug when you 'explain' why the Bank of England cut interest rates, in both cases understanding about as much as a parrot does about a cracker. Every now and then, however, you read a book that changes **how** you think, one that helps you see things beyond its few hundred pages slightly differently. That's what James Gleick's *Chaos* did for me. It's fantastic, I wish I'd read it much, much sooner, and anyone even remotely interested in science should make it their next book.

Single sentence description of chaos here. But a single sentence definition filled with impenetrable language doesn't really do this new approach to science justice. Instead of butchering a fuller explanation, I thought I'd run through an example on my home turf. Chapter 3 discusses chaos in the context of population biology by, in large part, recounting a [1976 paper](http://abel.harvard.edu/archive/118r_spring_05/docs/may.pdf) from Robert May. I heard a guest lecture from him once, describing how studying complex ecosystems had helped him advise on the re-design of the banking system. It all went a fair distance over my head at the time. But, I think a combination of recognising his name, familiarity with population biology, and the memory of faculty members' deference for May, made the chapter stick in my mind. Stickiest of all was Gleick's summary of May's argument:

> The world would be a better place... if every young student were given a pocket calculator and encouraged to play with the logistic difference equation. That simple calculation... could counter the distorted sense of the world's possibilities that comes from a standard scientific education.

Well, R is just a fancy pocket calculator. So, we best start playing.

# The logistic map

The Logistic Difference Equation: simplest discrete non-linear system.

Idea of discrtee time. One generation doesn't overlap with the next. 

All of the equations that follow are just rules telling us how we go from the total number of individuals in the population in one generation to the total number in the next.

Think of them as SPECIES WITH NOGs (maybe seasonal plants?) in your garden. Ignore predators. All that we want to know is if we have for example 5 this year,$N_t$, how many will we have next year, $N_{t+1}$?

One simple way we can think about this problem is to say that next year's population only depends on this year's:

Exponential growth

But if we want a little more realism then we can add in what population biologists call 'density dependence' and what mathematicians call 'non-linearity'. This leaves us with an equation of the form:

$$N_{t+1} = N_t(a - bN_{t})$$

In his paper May tells us that we can use a transformation to make the equation simpler to work with. He defines what I'll call the *population proportion* in generation $t$ as

$$x_t = \frac{bN_t}{a}$$

$x_t$ is the population in generation $t$ as a fraction of the maximum possible population. So, if $x_t = 0.5$, then the current population is half as big as the biggest one the environment could support. 

But where does this helpful substitution come from? (probs don't include this)

$$\begin{aligned}
N_{t+1} &= aN_t - bN_{t}^2 \\
\frac{\delta N_{t+1}}{\delta N_{t}} &= a - 2bN_t \\
2bN_t &= a \\
N_t &= \frac{a}{2b} \\
\end{aligned}$$

We can re-write the substitution in terms of $N$, 

$$N_t = \frac{ax_t}{b}$$

and then substitute it into our equation:

$$\begin{aligned}
N_{t+1} &= aN_t - bN_{t}^2 \\
\frac{ax_{t+1}}{b} &= a\frac{ax_t}{b} - b(\frac{ax_t}{b})^2 \\
\frac{ax_{t+1}}{b} &= \frac{a^2x_t}{b} - \frac{a^2x_t^2}{b} \\
ax_{t+1} &= a^2x_t - a^2x_t^2 \\
x_{t+1} &= ax_t - ax_t^2 \\
x_{t+1} &= ax_t(1-x_t)
\end{aligned}$$

What we end up with is an equation for the population proportion in generation t+1 as a function of the population proportion in generation t. 

```{r}
log_map_df <- expand.grid(a = c(seq(0.5, 4.5, 1)), x = c(seq(0, 1, 0.01))) %>%
  mutate(y = a*x*(1-x),
         a = as.factor(a))

log_map_df %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = y, col = a)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_continuous("Pop. prop. at t") +
  scale_y_continuous("Pop.\nprop\nat t+1", breaks = c(seq(0, 1.25, 0.25))) +
  scale_color_viridis_d("a") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_line(),
        axis.title.y = element_text(angle = 0, vjust = 0.5))
```

Make clear the distinction between linear and non-linear dynamics. It's not just about having a curved line, e.g. exponential growth is linear dynamics.

Play through the maths slowly.

But, how can we summarise this behaviour in a single graph. Make bifurcation diagram from May's paper.

Can you make bifurcation diagram interactive so the user can zoom in?

# Building non-linear intuitions

Bifurcation diagram is not intuitive at first glance because it's showing long run outcomes as a function of a tuning parameter rather than direct outcomes. Fortunately, there's been more than 40 years' worth of technological advancement since May's paper. This means that even a no-name chump who's not a Baron can build an interactive graph that helps make May's point a little easier to grasp.    

Walk through step by step what they can do with the graph.

Best way to build intuition is to do it yourself. 

So, I made a shiny app that allows you to choose the starting x point for the population.

Can choose 1 by itself or 2 to compare.

Then click play and watch as we move through different values of the tuning parameter, $a$. Regardless of which starting value(s) you choose, you'll see stability at first with the population converging on a single equilibrium value, then there'll be a transition to 2-period cycling with the population switching between two values, next 4-period cycles, 8-period cycles, and so on, and eventually chaos. 

```{r}
# Choose input options
x_rand <- round(runif(3), 2)
r_opts <- c(seq(2, 4, 0.05))
n_opts <- 100

# Use function
plot_df <- multiple_map(x_rand, r_opts, n_opts)
```

```{r, fig.width=9, fig.height=6}
# Vary r
plot_df %>%
  plot_ly(x = ~generation,
          y = ~x,
          color = ~start_x,
          hoverinfo = "text+name",
          text = ~paste("Generation:", generation, "<br>",
                        "Population:", round(x, 4)),
          frame = ~a) %>%
  add_lines() %>%
  animation_opts(frame = 800,
                 transition = 100,
                 easing = "linear") %>%
  animation_slider(currentvalue = list(prefix = "a = ",
                                       color = toRGB("black"),
                                       size = 25),
                   hide = FALSE) %>%
  layout(xaxis = list(title = "Generation"),
         yaxis = list(title = "Pop. Prop."))
```

Question: Why do mirrors around 0.5 behave the same?

# Studying non-elephant animals

In the conclusion of his paper, May argues that non-linearity should be taught, and taught early. As he saw it, learning to extend linear mathemetics with Fourier transforms, orthogonal functions, and regression techniques, misleads scientists about the world they're trying to understand. "The mathmetical intuition so developed ill equips the student to confront the bizarre behaviour exhibited by the simplest discrete nonlinear systems.", he wrote. "Yet such nonlinear systems are surely the rule, not the exception, outside the physical sciences."

The crucial notion that nonlinear systems are the norm rather than the exception is summed up in my favourite quote from *Chaos* which comes from the mathematician Stanislaw Ulam. He quipped that "to call the study of chaos 'nonlinear science' was like calling zoology 'the study of nonelephant animals'". That is, it's defining an entire subject in contrast to a niche class. 

The fact that vast swathes of science emphasise linearity has important implications. Something about people thinking in immediate causes from misunderstanding economics book. Poor at incorporating feedback loops or interative thinking. May's final sentence from over 40 years ago still rings true:

> "Not only in research, but also in the everday world of politics and economics, we would all be better off if more people realized that simple nonlinear systems do not necessarily possess simple dynamical properties."

Most things, especially the important things, are greater than the sum of their parts, and the hierarchical reductionism of much of science isn't going to help us understand them even close to well enough.
