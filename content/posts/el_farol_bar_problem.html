<p>I’m currently making my way through <em>Complexity and the Economy</em> by W. Brian Arthur. The book’s second chapter is a paper from 1994 called <a href="http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~wbarthur/Papers/El_Farol.pdf"><em>Inductive Reasoning and Bounded Rationality: The El Farol Problem</em></a>. It’s a fantastic example of how marrying psychological insights and a computational (rather than analytic) approach can produce novel, interesting, and intuive research in economics. So, I thought I’d have a go at using R to reproduce my own (simpler) version of the model described in the paper.</p>
<div id="background" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Background</h1>
<p>When Arthur was working at the Santa Fe Institute in 1993, there was a bar called El Farol where there was Irish music on thursday nights. He noted that people would go if they expected few people to be there, but avoided it if they expected it to be too busy. This problem is interesting because it creates something of a paradox where beliefs lead to outcomes that cause those beliefs to be proved false. If people expect many others to attend, then few will show up and the bar will be empty. If people expect nobody to attend, then everyone will show up and it’ll be packed. In both cases the original belief causes behaviour that means the belief ends up being incorrect.</p>
<p>Let’s generalise this phenomenon in a toy model similar to Arthur’s and see if we can gain any insight into the dynamics of attendance over time.</p>
</div>
<div id="model" class="section level1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Model</h1>
<div id="set-up" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Set-up</h2>
<p>100 people decide independently each week whether or not to attend a bar that offers music on a certain night. The music is enjoyable if the bar isn’t too busy, specifically if fewer than <span class="math inline">\(X\%\)</span> of the possible 100 people attend. There’s no way to tell in advance how many people will show up. So, each person goes if they expect fewer than <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> people to attend but stays home if they think more than <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> people will be there.</p>
<p>There’s no collusion or prior communication between possible attendees and the choice isn’t affected by whether the person was right or wrong in their beliefs about previous visits. The only info available is a list of the number of people who came in the past weeks.</p>
<p>For example, the past 10 weeks’ attendance might be:</p>
<pre><code>##  [1] 54 41 68 86 70 72 44 70 51 82</code></pre>
<p>Each of the 100 people can individually form <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> hypotheses they could use to predict the next week’s attendance based on the figures for the past <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> weeks. For example, their hypotheses could include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Predict the same as last week <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> 82 people</li>
<li>Predict a mirror image around 50 of last week <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> 18 people</li>
<li>Predict the average of the past four weeks <span class="math inline">\(\rightarrow\)</span> 62 people</li>
</ul>
<p>Each person decides to go out or stay in according to the currently most accurate prediction hypothesis in their individual set. If their best predictor says that fewer than <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> people will go, then they go. If their best predictor says that more than <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> people go, then they don’t.</p>

<div id="r-function" class="section level2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> R function</h2>
<p>For brevity I’ve hidden the code where I create the <code>sim_el_farol()</code> function but you can find it <a href="https://github.com/mitchelfruin/MitchThinks/blob/master/content/posts/el_farol_bar_problem.Rmd">here</a>.</p>
<p>All that’s crucial to know is that it takes two arguments.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>threshold =</code> specifies the crucial cut-off at which people believe the bar is or isn’t too busy.</li>
<li><code>n_rounds =</code> specifies the number of weeks to run the simulation for.</li>
</ul>
<p>The function outputs a dataframe with weekly attendance figures.</p>

<p>It exemplifies a common type of problem. Seems like the model is unrealistic but link to ‘busy at these times’ info on google, in exactly the situation the model describes. You know based on previous data, Tesco is usually empty at 3pm on a tuesday, but so does everyone else.</p>
<p>It shows the value of numerical solutions to problems when analytical ones become too hard or are impossible (in this case because of inductive reasoning).</p>
<p>Conclusion should relate to the Yogi Berra quote about his favourite restaurant in St. Louis, Ruggeri’s.</p>
