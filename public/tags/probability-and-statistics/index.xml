      <description>div#TOC li { list-style:none; background-image:none; background-repeat:none; background-position:0; }  We have heard a lot about ‘models’ in the news lately. For some people, this might be the first time they’ve ever properly considered just how one should go about making real-world decisions based on a fake-world computer simulation. There are plenty of great introductions to the kinds of modelling being done to understand the Coronovirus pandemic, for example in the washington post (link) on on rviews (link).</description>

      <description>1 Small samples are more extreme 2 Visualise the expected variation 3 Stats as slow thinking   div#TOC li { list-style:none; background-image:none; background-repeat:none; background-position:0; }  In 2006, the statistician Howard Wainer and the education researcher Harris Zwerling wrote a short research paper in which they present two facts about the rate of kidney cancer in US counties. Do me the favour of pausing after reading each and thinking about how you would explain them.</description>

      <description>0.1 Irrelevant differences 1 Research problems 1.1 p-value problems 1.2 Changes in probability    div#TOC li { list-style:none; background-image:none; background-repeat:none; background-position:0; }  If you want to see the code for this post then you can find the .Rmd file here.
0.1 Irrelevant differences Statistical significance is a widely misunderstood concept and I’ll cover the flaws in the null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) approach, of which it is a component, in more detail in a different post.</description>
