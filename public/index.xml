      <description>1 Linda’s birthday 2 Legal problems 3 Health problems 4 Research problems   div#TOC li { list-style:none; background-image:none; background-repeat:none; background-position:0; }  1 Linda’s birthday 1.1 The Linda problem  1.2 The Birthday puzzle  1.3 Bad intuitions These are just two examples from many which illustrate how our gut reactions can lead us astray.

      <description>1 Summary 2 Is the stat plausible? 3 What does the average mean? 4 Are the axes leading you astray? 5 Dodgy reporting   If you want to see the full code for this post then you can find the .Rmd file here.
1 Summary Levitin provides a solid compilation of mistakes to avoid and tricks to look out for when producing and reading research respectively. However, given his background in psychology and neuroscience, I was hoping for a more general thread pulling the examples together concerning why the human brain is ‘fooled’ by particular ways of presenting information rather than just what those presentations are.</description>
