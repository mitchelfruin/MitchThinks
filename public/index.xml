      <description>Rock Paper Scissors   NEED TO UPDATE WITH MY CODE, THIS IS SOMEONE ELSE’S. JUST A PLACEHOLDER.
Rock Paper Scissors In this second example we are going to use the same game, but this time several individuals will play against each other. To make it more interesting individuals are organised on a lattice network. Thus, they can only play with their direct neighbors. If they lose, they have to take over the strategy of the winner and vice versa.</description>

      <description>Evaluating Numbers Plausibility Averages Axes Reporting How numbers are collected Probabilities  Evaluating Words Identifying expertise Induction vs deduction    Evaluating Numbers Plausibility Numerical sense checks. Claim: “In the 35 years since marijuana laws stopped being enforced in California, the number of marijuana smokers has doubled every year”.
Even if we start with the most generous estimate that intitially there was 1 marijuana smoker then after 35 years that would give us \(2^{34} (&amp;gt; 17\text{bil})\) smokers.</description>

      <description>Critique of Traditional Economics E.g. Sugarscape   1st difference: Dynamics  Traditional:
 Closed, static, linear systems in equilibrium  Complexity:
 Open, dynamic, non-linear systems far from equilibrium    2nd difference: Agents  Traditional:
 Modeled collectively (homogenous) Use complex deductive calculations to make decisions Have complete information Random errors (no biases) No learning or adaptation (already optimal)  Complexity:
 Modeled individually (heterogenous) Use inductive heuristics to make decisions Have incomplete information Some biases Learn and adapt over time    3rd difference: Networks  Traditional:</description>
