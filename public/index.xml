 Closed, static, linear systems in equilibrium  Complexity:
 Open, dynamic, non-linear systems far from equilibrium    2nd difference: Agents  Traditional:
 Modeled collectively (homogenous) Use complex deductive calculations to make decisions Have complete information Random errors (no biases) No learning or adaptation (already optimal)  Complexity:
 Modeled individually (heterogenous) Use inductive heuristics to make decisions Have incomplete information Some biases Learn and adapt over time    3rd difference: Networks  Traditional:</description>
