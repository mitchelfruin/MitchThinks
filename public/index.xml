      <description>Agent-based modeling Rock, paper, scissors Side Blotched Lizards   Agent-based modeling Intro.
Use/relevance in complexity economics.
This article was inspired by this post, which I attempted to recreate and extend.
 Rock, paper, scissors Aim: Simulate simple rock, paper, scissors game to visualise a simple evolutionary process.
Simple Game Rules:
 Individuals are organised on a lattice network. Each individual has a strategy (Rock, Paper, Scissors). Each time period we choose one individual at random to play a game.</description>

      <description>Summary Illustration 1: Complexity Illustration 2: Growth   Summary Raworth proposes 7 changes to bring economics into the 21st century.
Goal: GDP growth \(\rightarrow\) The Doughnut.   Summarise chapter.  Big Picture: Self contained market \(\rightarrow\) Embedded economy.   Summarise chapter.  Behavioural: Rational economic man \(\rightarrow\) Social, adaptable humans.   Summarise chapter.  Complexity: Mechanical equilibrium \(\rightarrow\) Dynamic complexity.   Summarise chapter.  Inequality: Growth will even it up \(\rightarrow\) Distributive by design.</description>

      <description>Critique of Traditional Economics E.g. Sugarscape  1st difference: Dynamics 2nd difference: Agents 3rd difference: Networks 4th difference: Emergence 5th difference: Evolution   Critique of Traditional Economics E.g. Sugarscape   1st difference: Dynamics  Traditional:
 Closed, static, linear systems in equilibrium  Complexity:
 Open, dynamic, non-linear systems far from equilibrium    2nd difference: Agents  Traditional:
 Modeled collectively (homogenous) Use complex deductive calculations to make decisions Have complete information Random errors (no biases) No learning or adaptation (already optimal)  Complexity:</description>

      <description>Evaluating Numbers Plausibility Averages Axes Reporting How numbers are collected Probabilities  Evaluating Words Identifying expertise Induction vs deduction    Evaluating Numbers Plausibility Numerical sense checks. Claim: “In the 35 years since marijuana laws stopped being enforced in California, the number of marijuana smokers has doubled every year”.
Even if we start with the most generous estimate that intitially there was 1 marijuana smoker then after 35 years that would give us \(2^{34} (&amp;gt; 17\text{bil})\) smokers.</description>

      <description>The Site I built the site using the R package blogdown for a few reasons:
 To learn the (very) basics of web development. To post book summaries to encourage myself to read (and actually think about what I’ve read). To use R for something that didn’t feel like work.  The site is still very much a work-in-progress but is broadly split into two sections:
 Book summaries.  Selective summaries of non-fiction books.</description>
