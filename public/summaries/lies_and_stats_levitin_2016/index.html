<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>Levitin provides a solid compilation of mistakes to avoid and tricks to look out for when producing and reading research respectively. However, given his background in psychology and neuroscience, I was hoping for a more general thread pulling the examples together concerning <em>why</em> the human brain is ‘fooled’ by particular ways of presenting information rather than just <em>what</em> those presentations are.</p>
<p>The book’s main strength was illustrative examples some of which stuck in my mind and comprise the rest of this post.</p>
</div>
<div id="is-the-stat-plausible" class="section level1">
<h1>Is the stat plausible?</h1>
<p>The first thing to check when presented with a statistic, especially out of context, is whether the claim is even vaguely reasonable.</p>
<div id="back-of-the-napkin-calculations" class="section level2">
<h2>Back of the napkin calculations</h2>
<p>One way to check plausibility is a quick on-the-fly calculation.</p>
<p>Say, for example, we run into someone claiming that “in the 35 years since marijuana laws stopped being enforced in California, the number of marijuana smokers has doubled every year”.</p>
<p>Well, even if we start with the most generous estimate that initially there was only 1 lonely pothead in California, then if that number doubled every year for 35 years:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\text{Year 1:} \;\; 1 &amp;= 2^0 \\
\text{Year 2:} \;\; 2 &amp;= 2^1 \\
\text{Year 3:} \;\; 4 &amp;= 2^2 \\
\vdots \\
\text{Year 35:} \;\; &amp;= 2^{34} \\
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>So let’s see just how many marijuana smokers we’ve currently got if that stat holds:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Too high to count that high
2^34</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 17179869184</code></pre>
<p>Just over 17.1 billion people, which seems more than a little high.</p>
</div>
<div id="youve-taken-a-bath-before" class="section level2">
<h2>You’ve taken a bath before</h2>
<p>In a maths lecture at uni the professor began by writing a complicated looking formula on the board and told us that it described the time taken for a bath to empty as a function of its volume and the diameter of the plughole. He then asked us to raise our hand if we believed the bath would ever empty. When only a few people sheepishly did so he shouted up into the lecture theatre, “have you fucking taken a bath before?”. His point was, just because we’re dealing with supposedly scary maths doesn’t mean you should ignore common sense. You’ve taken a bath before, you know the answer, whether you understand the formula or not.</p>
<p>These kind of ‘wait, but we’re still talking about the real world’ checks can sometimes help assess the plausibility of a statistic. For example, in 1993 New Jersey adopted a ‘family cap’ law that denied additional benefits to mothers who had children whilst already on welfare. After two months, legislators were celebrating its success as births had already fallen by 16%. The only problem being that human pregnancies generally take a bit longer than that.</p>

<div id="all-averages-arent-made-equal" class="section level2">

<p>Humans on average have one testicle. Meaningless to compute an average on a metric over a whole population where there are important differences.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="are-the-axes-leading-you-astray" class="section level1">
<h1>Are the axes leading you astray?</h1>
<p>Manipulating the axes on a graph is one of the easiest ways to con a reader.</p>
<div id="truncated" class="section level2">
<h2>Truncated</h2>
<p>Shortening the proper range of y-axis values is often used to exaggerate the difference between two groups that are being compared.</p>
<p>For example, if I wanted to convince you that my product was way better than a competitor’s I might show you a bar chart reporting the average customer rating like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Bar chart with truncated y-axis
ggplot(product_ratings, aes(x = Product, y = mean_rating, fill = Product)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_fill_discrete(guide = &quot;none&quot;) +
  scale_y_continuous(&quot;Customer\nRating&quot;) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(67.5, 71.5)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.title.y = element_text(angle = 0, vjust = 0.5))</code></pre>
<p><img src="/summaries/lies_and_stats_Levitin_2016_files/figure-html/truncated%20bar%20chart-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>It looks like my product blows my competitor’s out of the water. However, notice where the y-axis starts and ends.</p>
<p>If we’re being strict, the y-axis should include the full range of values that customers were able to provide (it should at the very least include 0 if that’s a possible value). Once we properly format the graph my product looks a little less impressive:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Bar chart with truncated y-axis
ggplot(product_ratings, aes(x = Product, y = mean_rating, fill = Product)) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_fill_discrete(guide = &quot;none&quot;) +
  scale_y_continuous(&quot;Customer\nRating&quot;, limits = c(0, 100)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.title.y = element_text(angle = 0, vjust = 0.5))</code></pre>
<p><img src="/summaries/lies_and_stats_Levitin_2016_files/figure-html/full%20range%20bar%20chart-1.png" width="672" /></p>
</div>
<div id="discontinuous" class="section level2">
<h2>Discontinuous</h2>
<p>Condensing a small portion of the x-axis can be used to falsely emphasise a few data points.</p>
<p>For example, say I’m selling security systems and I want to put a scary graph on the leaflet I drop through people’s letterboxes. I might include a line graph like this one that exaggerates the recent increase in the number of burglaries:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tibble(Year = c(&quot;2009&quot;, &quot;2010&quot;, &quot;2011&quot;, &quot;2012&quot;, &quot;2013&quot;, &quot;2014&quot;, &quot;2019&quot;),
       burglary_count = c(100, 102.5, 105, 107.5, 110, 112.5, 125)) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = burglary_count)) +
  geom_line(group = 1) +
  scale_y_continuous(&quot;Burglary\nCount&quot;) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.title.y = element_text(angle = 0, vjust = 0.5))</code></pre>
<p><img src="/summaries/lies_and_stats_Levitin_2016_files/figure-html/discontinuous%20line%20graph-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>However, the apparent spike in burglaries is just an artefact of the fact that 5 year’s worth of increase has been squeezed into one notch on the x-axis.</p>
</div>
<div id="elongated" class="section level2">
<h2>Elongated</h2>
<p>Include axis space beyond the range of your data to make changes look more extreme.</p>
</div>
<div id="duplicate" class="section level2">
<h2>Duplicate</h2>
<p>If they measure the same thing then you can fudge the graph however you want. Only use if they’re different units and you want to make within axis comparisons not between. E.g. planned parenthood Jason Chaffetz.</p>

<p><strong>Amalgamating</strong>: group samples that differ on an important dimension to make the stat more shocking. “50% of 10-18 year olds are sexually active”.</p>
<p><strong>Subdividing</strong>: split things inconsistently to make your point more impressive. Divide all causes of death into subcategories apart from the one you want to promote. Should be equal bins (either by percentile of absolute).</p>

<h1>Probably not quite right</h1>
<div id="conditional-probabilities" class="section level2">
<h2>Conditional probabilities</h2>
<p>Sometimes probability is unintuitive. Birthday puzzle.</p>
<p><strong>Types.</strong> Classic, based on symmetry. Frequentist, based on experience. Subjective, based on best guess.</p>
<p><strong>Independent probabilities.</strong> Should multiply.</p>
<p><strong>Dependent/Conditional probabilities.</strong> Sally Clark had two children dies from SIDS. Dr. Meadow, pediatrician, said there’s 1 in 8543 chance of having a child die from SIDS giving a 1 in 73mil chance of having two children die from it. Potential genetic, environmental dependence ignored and she was sentenced for 3 years. Visualise Bayesian updating with a contingency table. Base rate neglect in medical test results.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-prosecutors-fallacy" class="section level2">
<h2>The prosecutor’s fallacy</h2>
<p><strong>Prosecutor’s fallacy:</strong> False belief that conditional probabilities are invertible when in fact they aren’t.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Pr(A|B) \neq Pr(B|A)\]</span></p>
<p>Forensics may compute that probability of blood at scene matching the defendent’s by chance is 1%. That doesn’t mean there’s a 1% chance the defendent is innocent. We have been told the probability of a match given innocence, we want the probability of innocence given a match, but they don’t equate:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Pr(\text{match}|\text{innocent}) \neq Pr(\text{innocent}|\text{match})\]</span></p>
