      <description>Agent-based modeling Rock, paper, scissors Side Blotched Lizards   Agent-based modeling Intro.
Use/relevance in complexity economics.
This article was inspired by this post, which I attempted to recreate and extend.
 Rock, paper, scissors Aim: Simulate simple rock, paper, scissors game to visualise a simple evolutionary process.
Simple Game Rules:
 Individuals are organised on a lattice network. Each individual has a strategy (Rock, Paper, Scissors). Each time period we choose one individual at random to play a game.</description>

 Closed, static, linear systems in equilibrium  Complexity:
 Open, dynamic, non-linear systems far from equilibrium    2nd difference: Agents  Traditional:
 Modeled collectively (homogenous) Use complex deductive calculations to make decisions Have complete information Random errors (no biases) No learning or adaptation (already optimal)  Complexity:</description>
