      <description>1 The Logistic Difference Equation 2 Bifurcation 3 Nonlinear Intuitions 4 Conclusion   div#TOC li { list-style:none; background-image:none; background-repeat:none; background-position:0; }  Most non-fiction books teach you what to think.

      <description>1 Rock, paper, scissors 2 Side Blotched Lizards 3 Agent-based modeling   div#TOC li { list-style:none; background-image:none; background-repeat:none; background-position:0; }  Do it yourself. Don’t use some other guy’s code.
The code for the simulations in this article was inspired by this post, which I attempted to recreate and extend. If you want to see the full code for this post then you can find the .Rmd file here.</description>

0.1 Irrelevant differences Statistical significance is a widely misunderstood concept and I’ll cover the flaws in the null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) approach, of which it is a component, in more detail in a different post.</description>
